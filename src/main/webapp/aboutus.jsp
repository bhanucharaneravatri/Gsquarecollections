        <h1>We are H&B travel agency</h1>
        <p>We are a car rental broker, meaning we arrange car rental on your behalf. We provide a place for you to compare deals from many different car rental companies, helping you find the right deal for you, every time.</p>

As a our customer:
<ul>
    <li>when you book your car, you enter into a contract with us: we are agreeing to arrange and manage your booking</li>
    <li>when you pick your car up, you enter into a contract with the rental company: they are agreeing to provide the car.</li>
</ul>
    <p>But our job doesn’t end once you’ve booked. We’re here for you if you need to change or cancel your booking, or if you have any questions or concerns – before, during or after your rental.</p>
